        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a future developer with a genuine passion for learning code and
          building new things. When I'm not studying coding challenges, you'll
          find me exploring different worlds as a gamer, enjoying everything
          from strategic challenges to immersive narratives.

          I also enjoy sports such as Basketball, Football, and Baseball. Sports
          have been a big part of my life and I have always found it a good way
          to exercise and have fun.

          My newest hobby has been Dungeons and Dragons. The creativity it
          allows and working with friends to complete an end goal is challenging
          and rewarding.
